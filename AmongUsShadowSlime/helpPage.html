    <h1>How to Use the Game Launcher</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Installation Steps</h2>
        <p>To install the game using the launcher, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download the Game Launcher:</strong> Visit the official website and click on the download link for the game launcher. Ensure you download the correct version for your operating system.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Run the Launcher:</strong> Once the download is complete, locate the launcher executable file in your downloads folder and double-click it to run. Make sure to allow any necessary permissions that may pop up.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Follow the Prompts:</strong> The launcher will guide you through the installation process. Since it's a console application, you will need to type whatever it tells you when prompted to proceed with the installation.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Installation Complete:</strong> Once the installation is finished, you will receive a confirmation message indicating the successful setup. You can now launch the game from the launcher.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Running the Game</h2>
        <p>After installation, you can easily run the game by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>In the launcher... </strong> After a process is complete it will Give you choices, One of them is Launching the game.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Or...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the Game executable:</strong> Same directory as the Launcher.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Updating the Game</h2>
        <p>The launcher is designed to automatically check for game updates. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Automatic Check:</strong> Each time you open the launcher, it will connect to the server and check if a new version of the game is available.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Update Notification:</strong> If an update is found, the launcher will notify you with a prompt asking if you want to download the update. You need to type 'yes' to proceed with the update.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Download and Install:</strong> If you choose to update, the launcher will download the latest version and install it automatically. You will see progress updates in the console until the installation is complete.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
